# Text to SQL project

- I would like to build a little project which would connect a llm to a database and then I would be able to ask questions in English and the llm would translate that into a query and retrieve relevant information from the database. 


## Alpha version = Alpha branch
- The overall goal is to ask a question in a console and get the llm to translate my question into SQL statement, retrieve data, and give me an answer. 
- use local sqlite with sample data
- develop small local LLM
